# Mystical Tutor ðŸ“šðŸ”®
Mystical Tutor is a dark, low-contrast, flat colorscheme for Vim and terminals. Although it works best with true colors (in GVim and supporting terminals with `set termguicolors`), it degrades gracefully to 256 and 16 colors for use with compatible terminals. Special attention has been paid to legibility in diff mode.

Note: A [kakoune](https://kakoune.org) version of the colorscheme is now available at [kakoune-mysticaltutor](https://github.com/caksoylar/kakoune-mysticaltutor).

## Installation
Download `colors/mysticaltutor.vim` into a `colors` folder in Vim's `runtimepath` e.g. `~/.vim` or `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles`. Alternatively, use your favorite package manager.

Put `colorscheme mysticaltutor` in your vimrc to enable.

## Terminal themes
Although not necessary for the Vim colorscheme to work, themes for some terminals are available under the `terminal` folder. Note that some of these are not tested, feel free to open an issue if you encounter problems.

A simple tmux theme (displayed below) that you can append to your `tmux.conf` can also be found in the same folder. It assumes you are using the terminal theme.
